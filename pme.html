    <h1>Assessment Brief</h1>
    <p>        This module is assessed through one graded element worth 100%. You must achieve at least 50% to 
        pass this module.
        For this assignment you are required to build a Project Management Consultancy Report based on 
        the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway Rehabilitation, which is a critical infrastructure project in Nigeria, 
        aimed at improving transportation and trade routes.
        CASE STUDY: Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road Rehabilitation
        One of Nigeria’s most important highways runs from North to South. The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano 
        Road forms a critical part of this larger highway system, enabling the movement of people and 
        products from the North to the South and vice versa - thereby uniting the Nigerian people and 
        economy, and connecting Nigeria to North Africa via the Lagos-Algiers Trans-African Highway.

        The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road (“AKR”) is a very critical carriageway that connects other parts of 
        Nigeria to the North, it cuts through Central Nigeria, Niger, Kaduna, and Kano States. The 
        carriageway is 375.9km long with 3 sections.
        Section I is 165.5km long and cuts across Abuja to Kaduna.
        Section II is 73.4km long and cuts across Kaduna to Zaria.
        PME – CW3 [S]
        Section III is 137km long and cuts across Zaria to Kano.
        The original scope involved the rehabilitation of 92.5km (25%) across the three sections of the 
        375.9km dual carriageway. The original scope was completed in November 2021.
        On June 18, 2020, Mr President directed that the scope of the AKR project be changed to full 
        reconstruction of the entire stretch of 375.9km.
        The revised scope of the project has attained an overall completion of 48% across the 3 sections as 
        at the second quarter (Q2) of 2023.
        On May 23,2023, President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned 200km of completed road on Section 
        II (Kaduna – Zaria) and Section III (Zaria – Kano) of the AKR.
        The revised scope of the project has attained an overall completion of 53% across the 3 sections as 
        of the third quarter (Q3) of 2023.
        To address the poor condition and deterioration of this priority road, Julius Berger is contracted to 
        rehabilitate and reconstruct 375.9 km of the Dual Carriageway: from the Federal Capital Territory 
        Abuja through Kaduna, excluding the Kaduna bypass, on to Zaria and further north to Kano.
        To deliver a value-driven solution, Julius Berger is constructing the 3 road sections simultaneously 
        and has pioneered the use of innovative cold recycling methodology. The efficient and 
        environmentally friendly solution results in complete rehabilitation by way of recycling the milled-off 
        pavement to produce a bitumen stabilized material, which is then utilized for paving the base course 
        layer of the new road. This methodology has numerous benefits.

        The new road will have an increased bearing capacity, compared to the previous pavement 
        constructed with granular base course, leading to an extended lifespan, it is environmentally friendly 
        and helps to conserve natural resources, considering the reduced need for new material to be mined 
        / damaged asphalt to be dumped, and furthermore, construction traffic is greatly reduced compared 
        to conventional methods, meaning fewer heavy load bearing trucks on the road, reducing road 
        congestion and diminishing the burden on the livelihood of the surrounding communities.
        The project is expected to drive economic growth through diversification: the increased economic 
        activity will contribute to the growth and diversification of the Nigerian economy.
        It is expected to drive community and regional development and enhance regional integration 
        including increased security along the route boosting economic activities and spur an increase in 
        investments, agriculture, and trade between commercial cities due to the improve and quicker 
        access to the market. 
        The road will significantly open the economic corridors leading to massive improvement in 
        manufacturing, trading, and commercial activities driven by the ease of movement of people, 
        services, and raw materials.
        The project is expected to boost economic activity and spur an increase in investments, agriculture, 
        and trade due to improved and quicker access to markets, as well as improved health and safety 
        along the route. The project has the potential to yield between 93,000 to 210,000 direct and indirect 
        jobs
